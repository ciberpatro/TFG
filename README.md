# VESortAl
Sorting algorithms are very important in the context of computer science; however, some of them may be difficult to understand for first-year students, especially those related to recursion.

One of the ways to present these algorithms to students, in order to facilitate their understanding, is through visualization options that allow following their trace step by step.

In this Final Degree Project, I developed the tool **VESortAl** that generates the visualization of a basic set of ordering algorithms and that also allows the possibility of editing is proposed. In this way, the student can causally assess the effects that the change carried out entails.
