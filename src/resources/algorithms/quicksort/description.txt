Quicksort is a divide and conquer algorithm.

First divides a large array into two smaller sub-arrays: the low elements and the high elements. Quicksort can then recursively sort the sub-arrays.

Worst-case performance    O(n2)
Best-case performance      O(n log n)
Average performance        O(n log n)
